          <p>(<i>Note</i>: I believe that I can fit into any of these roles, I would prefer to apply myself where needed depending on the team members and who can best lead depending on the task at hand! Thinking very situational‚Ä¶ I like to think of myself as a chameleon of sorts and I‚Äôve had the experience of working with different personalities and leading teams, as well as taking a backseat and learning from others who are more experienced with said task at hand‚Ä¶)</p>
